# IndustrialWirelessSensingAndControl

This computer code contains the computer code associated with the Industrial Wireless project developed 
under the industrial and manufacturing activities of the NIST Engineering Laboratory.  The Industrial Wireless 
project aims to research impacts and solutions of applying wireless communications technology to sensing
and real-time control of physical systems.  Our focus is on both existing and future wireless requirements, 
technologies, and solutions including ultra-relible and low latency communications (URLLC) for the control of physical 
systems.  

DISCLAIMER: Certain tools, commercial equipment, instruments, or materials are identified in this repository 
in order to specify the experimental procedure adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply 
recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the materials or equipment identified 
are necessarily the best available for the purpose.
